I'm a husband, dad, software engineer, and woodworker.

I also have a ridiculous amount of hobbies.

I read a LOT of sci-fi books, and I'll watch pretty much any sci-fi show. [Here's all the books I've read and my ratings.](/page/books)

I'm a cyclist, and have spent quite a bit of time cycle-camping through Spain with my wife.

I voted AGAINST brexit.
