I'm a husband, dad, and software engineer.

I also have a ridiculous amount of hobbies.

	- I don't really use twitter anymore, but that's [here](https://twitter.com/AndrewVos).

I read a LOT of sci-fi books, and I'll watch pretty much any sci-fi show. [Here's a link to books I've read and my ratings.](/page/books)

I'm also furniture builder/designer.

I'm a cyclist, and have spent quite a bit of time cycle-camping through Spain with my wife.

I voted AGAINST brexit.
