A 2d Game using only System.Drawing

Orblets is a simple 2d game, using nothing fancy just simple System.Drawing classes and some PInvoke for the audio playback.

The aim of the game is to group more than four Orblets together. You receive extra points for multipliers etc.

There are currently 30 levels, and it's really quite addictive. If you can get past level 30, you are a god.
