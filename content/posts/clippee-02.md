I really needed a clipboard manager, and I wanted it to be simple to use. I also didn't want a window showing me a million different items in it.

Introducing Clippee:

![Clippee](/images/clippee.png)

Clippee shows you a menu of recently copied items when you press CTRL+ALT+V. When you select an item, whatever is in the clipboard gets swapped with the selected item.

I haven't added support for saving items yet, but will do it soon.
Bugs/Requests in the comments please.
Clippee requires .NET Framework 2.0.
