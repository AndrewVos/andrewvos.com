I saw an [article on Hacker News](http://apps.ycombinator.com/item?id=2318159) about taking the digits of PI and expressing them as notes.

This inspired me to write a ruby script that does the same. The script is available on github [here](https://github.com/AndrewVos/pi-notes).

Here's a sound clip of this script:

<audio autobuffer='autobuffer' controls='controls' preload='auto'>
  <source src='/downloads/pi-notes.mp3'></source>
  <source src='/downloads/pi-notes.ogg'></source>
</audio>
