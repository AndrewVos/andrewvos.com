Add one teaspoon of sugar to each jar, then give the jar a small shake to spread it over the custard.

Fire up your blowtorch and burn the top of the sugar until it bubbles up.

A good technique is to hold the jar in one hand and the torch in the other. Rotate the jar slowly with your one hand, while flaming the sugar with the other.
